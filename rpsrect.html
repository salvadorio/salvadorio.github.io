            For our final, we were asked to make a Rock-Paper-Scissors app. I was particularly happy with how I built-in the rules to rock paper scissors in the main game play. 
            You'd swipe the cycle around to choose your shape, and in doing so, you'd naturally see which shape beats which. 

            This was my first time using figma as well, and I thought some of the little animations I used were fun and pleasant.
