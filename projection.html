                For this project, I worked with Sam to make something inspired by the work of Yoshi Sodeoka. She took pictures of DUMBO and edited them,
                and I wrote python code to calibrate a random webcam to watch the output of a projector. When someone passes in front of the projection, the webcam 
                would detect motion and a location using OpenCV and distort that area of the projected image. This would have 2 different trippy feedback-loop effects.
                There was some complicated pixel bitwise operation stuff going on layered with mask erosion, but also, any lasting impact you would have on the projection
                would create more movement after you're done, and more movment detected would cause more distortion, to an extent we calibrated. I generally really like image 
                processing stuff, so it was a fun project.

                <p>This is the OpenCV motion sensing layer. I really like how my hair looks. </p>

                </video>
                <p>This is, like, a visual reverby effect that is the basis of the feedback loop that comes from the camera seeing the projector and the projector mirroring the camera.</p>

                </video>
                <p> This is how the image output was distorted by movement, without the eventual visual feedback loop of "watching" itself.</p>

                <p> This is a cool effect we found, not really sure why it did this, and any of my guesses would take too long to write out.
                    When watched as a time lapse, it's even crazier because there's this very slow consistent rotation pattern to the "teeth" at the top.
