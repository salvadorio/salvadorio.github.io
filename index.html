            <h1>about me</h2>
            <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hi! my name is sal. i use he/him pronouns. i like a lot of things. i like programming. i like playing the guitar. i like dominic fike. i've had
                fun making this website, but more because i like looking back at pictures and remembering old projects than because i'm the world's biggest 
                html fan. it's fine, i guess, but i've had more success generating stuff thru javascript. which is maybe what you're supposed to do - i don't know
                what the best practices are. i will hopefully find out in this web dev class. i like 3d modelling in blender. i forgot to bring my drawing pad to college and
                my parents are kind of moving so i just got a new one and it's probably coming sometime today which is very exciting. i like guitar pedals a lot. my favorite
                is the boss MO-2. when it arrived, the guy in japan that i bought it from gave me a little similarly-colored paper crane and it was cute and i felt a connection
                to a stranger which is quite a valuable feeling. i guess the internet has shown us how such connections can be dangerous, but the internet will show us a lot of things
                and even if sometimes the revelations are unfortunate it also has created some very beautiful things and opened up a lot of possibilities for future beautiful things. 
                even if it's not worth it, it's not like we can go back to a time without it so we might as well make the most beauty we can out of it. i also like
                digital effects. i really like the funky and creative websites that some digtial effects producers write make. like Freakshow Industries and PRISMA.
                it's nice when the artistry of people and groups shines past their primary creative outlet. i like talking. recently, i've been listening to ca7riel and paco amoroso and
                i've quite liked their music. i like cnc machines - routers, lasercutters, embroidery. my college experience has shown me the light of lasercutting.
                it's so much faster than routing everything and the 2d limitations can be worked around. it's neat how data and ideas can come to life at a scale or precision
                that we couldn't reach alone. i am very grateful for the opportunity to keep doing all these things i love in college and for the possibility that i could
                continue to do so after college.
