                        This is an auto-wah pedal, and my first pedal. It's funky, and it will bring out the dynamics of your playing
                        even if you end up compressing it later.

                        This is an overtone pedal - a little weirder. At lower settings, it can help make lower or higher harmonics pop. At higher settings,
                        you can get organ or synthy sounds. Very fun! It also has some modulation capabilities built in. Because of some stereo modulation stuff, after this point
                        in my signal chain, we're working in stereo.

                    <p>
                        While this is mainly a compressor, it's also one of the few stereo distortion pedals out there. And it can do this weird swell effect,
                        where it eases volume up as you sustain a note. It's supposed to be violin-ish, and remove the transient caused by hitting the string,
                        but I don't really use it.

                        This thing can do a lot, and I don't think I make anything that uses it to it's full potential. It can do
                        basic reverb and delay effects, but it's real strength is in the interplay between short time-based effects
                        and it's second module of longer time-based effects. And it has some sort of bitcrushing memory thing built in.
                        I really don't know what's going on with it.

                        This is just so I don't need to buy and mic up an amp. I can download impulse response patterns into it? Which is pretty cool. 
                        And it sounds nice.
