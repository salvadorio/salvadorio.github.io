            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I made this music-maker for my Creative Coding final. The whole thing follows the chord progression dictated by the little
            numbers in the top corner (by default a ii-v-i pattern), but this can be adjusted, even to follow unusual time signatures. The key 
            can be changed with the slider all the way to top the left. After the project settings, there are a bunch of individual sound synthesizers.
            The first three make a chord because they all follow the chort pattern perfectly (zero pitch variation) and are transposed 2 and 4 notes within the selected key (1, 3, 5).
            Each synth's rhythm is determined through a recursive function that subdivides the measure randomly (determined by rhythVari) as well as a constant
            subdivision based on the subdiv value.
